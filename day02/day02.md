## Exercise 01

Task:Please write a SQL statement which returns the missing days from 1st to 10th of January 2022 (including all days) for visits  of persons with identifiers 1 or 2 (it means days missed by both). Please order by visiting days in ascending mode. The sample of data with column name is presented below.

code:
```
WITH date_series AS (
    SELECT generate_series('2022-01-01'::date, '2022-01-10'::date, '1 day'::interval) AS visit_date
)
SELECT ds.visit_date::date AS missing_date
FROM date_series ds
LEFT JOIN person_visits pv ON ds.visit_date = pv.visit_date 
    AND pv.person_id IN (1, 2)
GROUP BY ds.visit_date
HAVING COUNT(pv.person_id) < 2
ORDER BY ds.visit_date;

FROM 
    person p
CROSS JOIN 
    pizzeria pi

ORDER BY 
    person_name, visit_date, pizzeria_name;

## Exercise 03

Task:Letâ€™s return back to Exercise #01, please rewrite your SQL by using the CTE (Common Table Expression) pattern. Please move into the CTE part of your "day generator". The result should be similar like in Exercise #01

| missing_date | 
| ------ | 
| 2022-01-03 | 
| 2022-01-04 | 
| 2022-01-05 | 
| ... |


code:
```
WITH date_series AS (
    SELECT generate_series('2022-01-01'::date, '2022-01-10'::date, '1 day'::interval) AS visit_date
),
missing_dates AS (
    SELECT ds.visit_date::date AS missing_date
    FROM date_series ds
    LEFT JOIN person_visits pv ON ds.visit_date = pv.visit_date 
        AND pv.person_id IN (1, 2)
    WHERE pv.visit_date IS NULL
)
SELECT missing_date
FROM missing_dates
ORDER BY missing_date;
